What this code does

It predicts whether a person will buy ice cream (yes or no) based on:

Temperature (hot / cool)

Weather (rainy / sunny)

using Naive Bayes Theorem:
𝑃(Class | Features)∝𝑃(Class)×𝑃(Feature1∣Class)×𝑃(Feature2∣Class)
P(Class | Features)∝P(Class)×P(Feature1∣Class)×P(Feature2∣Class)

Dataset
Temperature	Weather	Ice_cream
hot	rainy	yes
cool	sunny	yes
cool	sunny	no
hot	sunny	yes
cool	rainy	yes
cool	rainy	no

This is stored as a NumPy array and printed in DataFrame form.

Input

The user enters something like:

cool sunny
→ meaning temperature = cool, weather = sunny

Computation Steps
Extract each column

The lists list_temprature, list_weather, and list_ice_cream store all the values separately.

Count occurrences

You count:

how many yes and no

how often the given temperature occurs with yes and no

how often the given weather occurs with yes and no

Compute probabilities

P_yes = total yes / total samples

P_no = total no / total samples

P(temp | yes) = how many times that temperature appeared with yes / total yes

P(temp | no) = how many times that temperature appeared with no / total no

same for weather

Apply Naive Bayes formula
𝑃(yes | temp, weather)=𝑃(yes)×𝑃(temp | yes)×𝑃(weather | yes)
P(yes | temp, weather)=P(yes)×P(temp | yes)×P(weather | yes)

and similarly for no.

Then whichever probability is higher → that’s your prediction.

Example Run

If you input:

cool sunny


It might output:

probaility of yes ice cream is [0.0370]
probaility of no ice cream is [0.0185]
in a cool temprature and sunny weather, the person will buy ice cream
