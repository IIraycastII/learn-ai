1. Data simulation

You generate 100 random x and y values between 80 and 100.
They represent two input features for a simple neuron.

2. Weighted sum (the neuron’s input)

You compute:

𝑧=𝑤1𝑥+𝑤2𝑦+𝑏
z=w1​x+w2y+b

Here both weights w1 and w2 are set to 1, and bias b = 0, so:

𝑧=𝑥+𝑦z=x+y

This gives a combined activation input for each data pair.

3. Scaling (normalization)

The raw z values can be large (e.g., around 160–200 since x and y ≈ 80–100).
To make the sigmoid curve meaningful, you normalize all z values into the range [-10, 10], which is the region where the sigmoid changes most sharply:

𝑧scaled=(𝑧−𝑧min⁡)(𝑧max⁡−𝑧min)×20−10z
scaled=(zmax−zmin)(z−zmin)×20−10

This step ensures your sigmoid plot shows the classic “S” shape.

4. Applying the sigmoid function

You then compute:

𝜎(𝑧)=11+𝑒−𝑧
σ(z)=1+e−z1

for each scaled z value.
This converts each input into a value between 0 and 1, which is the neuron's activation output — the probability-like interpretation.

5. Plot 1 – Sigmoid curve

You sort the scaled z values and plot σ(z) vs. z, giving you the classic S-shaped sigmoid curve.

The red dashed line at 0.5 represents the decision threshold — the point where the neuron output switches from "off" (0) to "on" (1).

6. Plot 2 – Original data visualization

You also display a scatter plot of the original (x, y) points — purely for reference, showing the random data that fed into the neuron’s weighted sum.
