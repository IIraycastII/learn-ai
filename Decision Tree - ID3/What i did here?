Step-by-step Understanding
1. Dataset Setup
dataset = np.array([
    ["sunny", "sunny", "rainy", "sunny", "sunny", "sunny"],
    ["cool", "cool", "cool", "hot", "cool", "hot"],
    ["play tennis", "play tennis", "dont play", "play tennis", "dont play", "dont play"]
])


You made a 3-row dataset:

Row 0 → Weather

Row 1 → Temperature

Row 2 → Target output ("play tennis" or "dont play")

You then printed it as a DataFrame just to view it neatly.

2. Count basic frequencies

You counted how many times:

Tennis was played (play_tennis_count)

Tennis wasn’t played (dont_play_count)

Then you found the probability of each outcome and calculated the base entropy (the total uncertainty of the output).

So you now know:
👉 “How uncertain the overall decision is before splitting by any feature.”

3. Calculate entropy for ‘Weather’ feature

You looped through and counted:

How many sunny and rainy examples there are.

Within each, how many are play and dont play.

Then you calculated the entropy for sunny and entropy for rainy — i.e.,
“How mixed or pure each weather condition’s outcomes are.”

Then you took their weighted average:

weighted_entropy_weather = (P(sunny)*entropy_sunny) + (P(rainy)*entropy_rainy)


This gives the expected entropy after splitting by weather.

4. Calculate entropy for ‘Temperature’ feature

Same logic — you found counts for:

Cool (and how many played/didn't)

Hot (and how many played/didn't)

Then you computed:

entropy_cool

entropy_hot

And their weighted average weighted_entropy_temperature

5. Compute Information Gain

You calculated:

information_gain_weather = entropy - weighted_entropy_weather
information_gain_temperature = entropy - weighted_entropy_temperature


This tells how much entropy (uncertainty) each feature reduces.
The feature with higher information gain is the better one to split first.

6. Choose the feature with highest gain

You compared the two:

if information_gain_temprature > information_gain_weather:
    ...
else:
    ...


Then printed which “path” (feature) you chose — weather or temperature.

You also checked whether any entropy = 0 for a feature, meaning it reached a leaf node (perfectly classified).

Example:

If entropy_hot == 0, then “Hot” always leads to one decision (pure branch).

If not, you said "leaf node not achieved and changing input feature", meaning you’d continue splitting (like a real decision tree would).

7. Path tracking

You used path_taken as a flag to note that you’ve started moving through features and prevent reusing the same one again.

Step	Action	Concept
1	Created dataset	Weather, Temperature, and Target
2	Counted overall play/don’t play	Frequency
3	Calculated base entropy	Uncertainty before split
4	Calculated entropy for weather	Entropy for “sunny” & “rainy”
5	Calculated entropy for temperature	Entropy for “cool” & “hot”
6	Computed information gain for both	How much uncertainty is reduced
7	Chose best feature (higher IG)	Decision Tree Root
8	Checked for leaf nodes	Stop if data is pure
