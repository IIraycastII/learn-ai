Step-by-step breakdown
1. Creating the dataset
dataset = np.array([
    [5.7, 4.3, 8.8, 2.5, 6.7, 3.0, 5.8],
    [5.6, 7.4, 6.5, 3.2, 2.1, 6.4, 7.8]
])


You created a dataset of 7 points, each with:

An x-coordinate (first row)

A y-coordinate (second row)

So your dataset looks like 7 points in a 2D plane.

2. Randomly choosing initial centroids
centroid_x_1 = random.choices(dataset[0])
centroid_y_1 = random.choices(dataset[1])
centroid_x_2 = random.choices(dataset[0])
centroid_y_2 = random.choices(dataset[1])


Here, you randomly picked two points from your dataset as the starting centroids:

C1 → (centroid_x_1, centroid_y_1)

C2 → (centroid_x_2, centroid_y_2)

Then you made sure they’re not the same.
This is your initial cluster centers.

3. Separating data into x and y lists
x_coordinates = list(map(float, dataset[0]))
y_coordinates = list(map(float, dataset[1]))


You extracted the x and y values from your dataset separately for easier use later.

4. Calculating distances from centroids
distance_1.append(math.sqrt(((x_coordinates[i] - centroid_x_1[0]) ** 2) + ((y_coordinates[i] - centroid_y_1[0]) ** 2)))
distance_2.append(math.sqrt(((x_coordinates[i] - centroid_x_2[0]) ** 2) + ((y_coordinates[i] - centroid_y_2[0]) ** 2)))


For every point in the dataset:

You calculated the Euclidean distance between the point and each centroid.
This helps determine which centroid each point is closer to.

5. Assigning points to clusters
if distance_1[i] > distance_2[i]:
    new_data.append("C1")
elif distance_2[i] > distance_1[i]:
    new_data.append("C2")


Each data point is assigned to:

Cluster C1 if it’s closer to the first centroid

Cluster C2 if it’s closer to the second centroid

So you’re grouping data by proximity.

6. Updating centroids

When a point gets assigned to a cluster, you slightly shift that cluster’s centroid toward the point:

centroid_x_1 = [(centroid_x_1[0] + x_coordinates[i]) / 2]
centroid_y_1 = [(centroid_y_1[0] + y_coordinates[i]) / 2]


This mimics the centroid update step in K-Means — moving each centroid toward the mean of the points assigned to it.

So the centroids become more “representative” of their cluster with each new point.

7. Adding cluster labels back into dataset
dataset = np.vstack((dataset, new_data))
print(dataset)


Finally, you stacked the cluster labels (C1, C2) onto your dataset — showing which point belongs to which cluster.
