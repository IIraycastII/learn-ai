1. Dataset Setup

You start with:

Study Hours	Attendance	Results
2	60	fail
4	75	pass
1	40	fail
5	80	pass

You convert “pass” → 1 and “fail” → 0, so the neural model can process numbers.

2. Model Initialization

You define:

weights_1 = 0.1 → for study hours

weights_2 = -0.3 → for attendance

bias = -0.2

learning_rate = 0.1

This model is a single-layer perceptron:
𝑧=(𝑤1×𝑥1)+(𝑤2×𝑥2)+𝑏
z=(w1×x1)+(w2×x2)+b

And the output rule is:

if 𝑧≥0.3⇒predict 1(pass),else 0(fail)
if z≥0.3⇒predict 1 (pass), else 0 (fail)
3. Data Normalization

Before training, you normalize both input features between 0 and 1:
𝑥′=𝑥−min(𝑥)max(𝑥)−min(𝑥)
x′=max(x)−min(x)x−min(x)
	​


This ensures features are in the same scale — a key step for gradient-based learning.

4. Learning Loop

You run the perceptron for multiple iterations (input_times).

For each training example:

Compute the weighted sum:

𝑧=𝑤1𝑥1+𝑤2𝑥2+𝑏
z=w1x1+w2x2+b

Apply the threshold to get the predicted output (0 or 1).

Compare it to the actual output (input_3).

If prediction is wrong, update the weights:

𝑤𝑖=𝑤𝑖+𝜂×(𝑦−𝑦^)×𝑥𝑖
wi=wi+η×(y−y^​)×xi
𝑏=𝑏+𝜂×(𝑦−𝑦^)
b=b+η×(y−y^)

where:
η = learning rate
y = actual result
y^= predicted result

This update rule is the core perceptron learning algorithm.

5. Accuracy Tracking

For every correct prediction, you increase correct_count.
At the end, you print how many predictions were correct across all iterations.
